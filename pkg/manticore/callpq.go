/* Pqflags determines boolean flags for CallQP options
This flags are unified into one bitfield used instead of bunch of separate flags.

There are the following flags for CallPQ modes available:

NeedDocs

NeedDocs require to provide numbers of matched documents. It is either order numbers from the set of provided documents,
or DocIDs, if documents are JSON and you pointed necessary field which contains DocID. (NOTE: json PQ calls are not yet
implemented via API, it will be done later).

NeedQuery

NeedQuery require to return not only QueryID of the matched queries, but also another information about them.
It may include query itself, tags and filters.

Verbose

Verbose, require to return additional meta-information about matching and queries. It causes daemon to fill fields TmSetup, TmTotal,
QueriesFailed, EarlyOutQueries and QueryDT of SearchPqResponse structure.

SkipBadJson

SkipBadJson, require to not fail on bad (ill-formed) jsons, but warn and continue processing. This flag works only for
bson queries and useless for plain text (may even cause warning if provided there).

	NeedDocs Pqflags = (1 << iota)
	NeedQuery
	jsonDocs
	Verbose
	SkipBadJson
)

/* SearchPqOptions incapsulates params to be passed to CallPq function.

Flags

Flags is instance of Pqflags, different bites described there.

IdAlias

IdAlias determines name of the field in supplied json documents, which contain DocumentID. If NeedDocs flag is set,
this value will be used in resultset to identify documents instead of just plain numbers of them.

Shift

Shift is used if daemon returns order number of the documents (i.e. when NeedDoc flag is set, but no IdAlias provided,
or if documents are just plain texts and can't contain such field at all). Shift then is just added to every number of
the doc, helping move the whole range. Say, if you provide 2 documents, they may be returned as numbers 1 and 2.
Buf if you also give Shift=100, they will became 101 and 102. It may help if you distribute bit docset over several
instances and want to keep the numbers. Daemon itself uses this value for the same purpose.

/*
CallQP perform check if a document matches any of the predefined criterias (queries)
It returns list of matched queries and may be additional info as matching clause, filters, and tags.

`index` determines name of PQ index you want to call into. It can be either local, either distributed
built from several PQ agents

`values` is the list of the index. Each value regarded as separate index. Order num of matched indexes then may
be returned in resultset

`opts` packed options. See description of SearchPqOptions for details.
In general you need to make instance of options by calling NewSearchPqOptions(), set
desired flags and options, and then invoke CallPQ, providing desired index, set of documents and the options.

Since this function expects plain text documents, it will remove all flags about json from the options, and also will
not use IdAlias, if any provided.

For example:
  ..
  po := NewSearchPqOptions()
  po.Flags = NeedDocs | Verbose | NeedQuery
  resp, err := cl.CallPQ("pq",[]string{"angry test","filter test doc2",},po)
  ...
