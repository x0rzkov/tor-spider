/*
ERankMode selects query relevance ranking mode. It is set via `SetRankingMode()` and `SetRankingExpression()` functions.

Manticore ships with a number of built-in rankers suited for different purposes. A number of them uses two factors,
phrase proximity (aka LCS) and BM25. Phrase proximity works on the keyword positions, while BM25 works on the keyword
frequencies. Basically, the better the degree of the phrase match between the document body and the query, the higher
is the phrase proximity (it maxes out when the document contains the entire query as a verbatim quote). And BM25 is
higher when the document contains more rare words. We’ll save the detailed discussion for later.

Currently implemented rankers are:

RankProximityBm25

RankProximityBm25, the default ranking mode that uses and combines both phrase proximity and BM25 ranking.

RankBm25

RankBm25, statistical ranking mode which uses BM25 ranking only (similar to most other full-text engines).
This mode is faster but may result in worse quality on queries which contain more than 1 keyword.

RankNone

RankNone, no ranking mode. This mode is obviously the fastest. A weight of 1 is assigned to all matches.
This is sometimes called boolean searching that just matches the documents but does not rank them.

RankWordcount

RankWordcount, ranking by the keyword occurrences count. This ranker computes the per-field keyword occurrence counts,
then multiplies them by field weights, and sums the resulting values.

RankProximity

RankProximity, returns raw phrase proximity value as a result. This mode is internally used to emulate MatchAll queries.

RankMatchany

RankMatchany, returns rank as it was computed in SPH_MATCH_ANY mode earlier, and is internally used to emulate MatchAny queries.

RankFieldmask

RankFieldmask, returns a 32-bit mask with N-th bit corresponding to N-th fulltext field, numbering from 0.
The bit will only be set when the respective field has any keyword occurrences satisfying the query.

RankSph04

RankSph04, is generally based on the default SPH_RANK_PROXIMITY_BM25 ranker, but additionally boosts the matches when
they occur in the very beginning or the very end of a text field. Thus, if a field equals the exact query,
SPH04 should rank it higher than a field that contains the exact query but is not equal to it. (For instance, when
the query is “Hyde Park”, a document entitled “Hyde Park” should be ranked higher than a one entitled “Hyde Park,
London” or “The Hyde Park Cafe”.)

RankExpr

RankExpr, lets you specify the ranking formula in run time. It exposes a number of internal text factors and lets you
define how the final weight should be computed from those factors.

RankExport

RankExport, rank by BM25, but compute and export all user expression factors

RankPlugin

RankPlugin, rank by user-defined ranker provided as UDF function.

ESortOrder selects search query sorting orders

There are the following result sorting modes available:

SortRelevance

SortRelevance sorts by relevance in descending order (best matches first).

SortAttrDesc

SortAttrDescmode sorts by an attribute in descending order (bigger attribute values first).

SortAttrAsc

SortAttrAsc mode sorts by an attribute in ascending order (smaller attribute values first).

SortTimeSegments

SortTimeSegments sorts by time segments (last hour/day/week/month) in descending order, and then by relevance in descending order.
Attribute values are split into so-called time segments, and then sorted by time segment first, and by relevance second.

The segments are calculated according to the current timestamp at the time when the search is performed,
so the results would change over time. The segments are as follows:

last hour,

last day,

last week,

last month,

last 3 months,

everything else.

These segments are hardcoded, but it is trivial to change them if necessary.

This mode was added to support searching through blogs, news headlines, etc. When using time segments, recent records
would be ranked higher because of segment, but within the same segment, more relevant records would be ranked higher -
unlike sorting by just the timestamp attribute, which would not take relevance into account at all.

SortExtended

SortExtended sorts by SQL-like combination of columns in ASC/DESC order. You can specify an SQL-like sort expression
with up to 5 attributes (including internal attributes), eg:

@relevance DESC, price ASC, @id DESC

Both internal attributes (that are computed by the engine on the fly) and user attributes that were configured for this
index are allowed. Internal attribute names must start with magic @-symbol; user attribute names can be used as is.
In the example above, @relevance and @id are internal attributes and price is user-specified.

Known internal attributes are:

@id (match ID)

@weight (match weight)

@rank (match weight)

@relevance (match weight)

@random (return results in random order)

@rank and @relevance are just additional aliases to @weight.

SortExpr

SortExpr sorts by an arithmetic expression.

`SortRelevance` ignores any additional parameters and always sorts matches by relevance rank.
All other modes require an additional sorting clause, with the syntax depending on specific mode.
SortAttrAsc, SortAttrDesc and SortTimeSegments modes require simply an attribute name.
SortRelevance is equivalent to sorting by “@weight DESC, @id ASC” in extended sorting mode,
SortAttrAsc is equivalent to “attribute ASC, @weight DESC, @id ASC”,
and SortAttrDesc to “attribute DESC, @weight DESC, @id ASC” respectively.

Qflags is bitmask with query flags which is set by calling Search.SetQueryFlags()
Different values have to be combined with '+' or '|' operation from following constants:

QflagReverseScan

Control the order in which full-scan query processes the rows.
  0 direct scan
  1 reverse scan

 QFlagSortKbuffer

Determines sort method for resultset sorting.
The result set is in both cases the same; picking one option or the other
may just improve (or worsen!) performance.
  0 priority queue
  1 k-buffer (gives faster sorting for already pre-sorted data, e.g. index data sorted by id)

QflagMaxPredictedTime

Determines if query has or not max_predicted_time option as an extra parameter
  0 no predicted time provided
  1 query contains predicted time metric

QflagSimplify

Switch on query boolean simplification to speed it up
If set to 1, daemon will simplify complex queries or queries that produced by different algos to eliminate and
optimize different parts of query.
  0 query will be calculated without transformations
  1 query will be transformed and simplified.

List of performed transformation is:

 common NOT
  ((A !N) | (B !N)) -> ((A|B) !N)

 common compound NOT
  ((A !(N C)) | (B !(N D))) -> (((A|B) !N) | (A !C) | (B !D)) // if cost(N) > cost(A) + cost(B)

 common sub-term
  ((A (X | C)) | (B (X | D))) -> (((A|B) X) | (A C) | (B D)) // if cost(X) > cost(A) + cost(B)

 common keywords
  (A | "A B"~N) -> A
  ("A B" | "A B C") -> "A B"
  ("A B"~N | "A B C"~N) -> ("A B"~N)

 common PHRASE
  ("X A B" | "Y A B") -> (("X|Y") "A B")

 common AND NOT factor
  ((A !X) | (A !Y) | (A !Z)) -> (A !(X Y Z))

 common OR NOT
  ((A !(N | N1)) | (B !(N | N2))) -> (( (A !N1) | (B !N2) ) !N)

 excess brackets
  ((A | B) | C) -> ( A | B | C )
  ((A B) C) -> ( A B C )

 excess AND NOT
  ((A !N1) !N2) -> (A !(N1 | N2))

 QflagPlainIdf

 Determines how BM25 IDF will be calculated. Below ``N'' is collection size, and ``n'' is number of matched documents
  1 plain IDF = log(N/n), as per Sparck-Jonesor
  0 normalized IDF = log((N-n+1)/n), as per Robertson et al

QflagGlobalIdf

Determines whether to use global statistics (frequencies) from the global_idf file for IDF computations,
rather than the local index statistics.
  0 use local index statistics
  1 use global_idf file (see https://docs.manticoresearch.com/latest/html/conf_options_reference/index_configuration_options.html#global-idf)

QflagNormalizedTfIdf

Determines whether to divide IDF value additionally by query word count, so that TF*IDF fits into [0..1] range
  0 don't divide IDF by query word count
  1 divide IDF by query word count

Notes for QflagPlainIdf and QflagNormalizedTfIdf flags

The historically default IDF (Inverse Document Frequency) in Manticore is equivalent to
QflagPlainIdf=0, QflagNormalizedTfIdf=1, and those normalizations may cause several undesired effects.

First, normalized idf (QflagPlainIdf=0) causes keyword penalization. For instance, if you search for [the | something]
and [the] occurs in more than 50% of the documents, then documents with both keywords [the] and [something] will get
less weight than documents with just one keyword [something]. Using QflagPlainIdf=1 avoids this. Plain IDF varies
in [0, log(N)] range, and keywords are never penalized; while the normalized IDF varies in [-log(N), log(N)] range,
and too frequent keywords are penalized.

Second, QflagNormalizedTfIdf=1 causes IDF drift over queries. Historically, we additionally divided IDF by query
keyword count, so that the entire sum(tf*idf) over all keywords would still fit into [0,1] range. However, that
means that queries [word1] and [word1 | nonmatchingword2] would assign different weights to the exactly same result
set, because the IDFs for both “word1” and “nonmatchingword2” would be divided by 2. QflagNormalizedTfIdf=0
fixes that. Note that BM25, BM25A, BM25F() ranking factors will be scaled accordingly once you
disable this normalization.

QflagLocalDf

Determines whether to automatically sum DFs over all the local parts of a distributed index,
so that the IDF is consistent (and precise) over a locally sharded index.
  0 don't sum local DFs
  1 sum local DFs

QflagLowPriority

Determines priority for executing the query
  0 run the query in usual (normal) priority
  1 run the query in idle priority

QflagFacet

Determines slave role of the query in multi-query facet
  0 query is not a facet query, or is main facet query
  1 query is depended (slave) part of facet multiquery

QflagFacetHead

Determines slave role of the query in multi-query facet
  0 query is not a facet query, or is slave of facet query
  1 query is main (head) query of facet multiquery

QflagJsonQuery

Determines if query is originated from REST api and so, must be parsed as one of JSON syntax
  0 query is API query
  1 query is JSON query
