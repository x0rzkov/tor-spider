# OnionTree

Welcome to OnionTree: a repository of Tor hidden services.

## Main pillars

Why another link list/database/directory? It's true, there are many popular
resources to get your links from. We, however, have a different set of values,
something we yet have to see in others. 

### 1. Transparency

Every change to the repository is done in a transparent manner. Anyone who has
access to this repository can see who made what changes (see commit log). This
prevents behind-the-scenes link swapping or other malicious practices.

This format also allows for discussion about inclusion/deletion of a service
via pull requests, allowing community to steer the project democratically.

### 2. Openness

Data are open source. Tools created specially for this project are a free
software. Anyone can copy distribute and share the work without limitations.
This model inherently prevents from having a single point of failure.

### 3. Accessibility

Data are stored in YAML files. This format makes editing by humans and
processing by a computer code easy. Whatever's your favorite programming
language, there's a library for it.

Now, any project, requiring onion addresses, can use this data instead of
spending hours and hours of building their own database.

### 4. Credibility

All contributions must be verified for authenticity and signed with
contributor's PGP key.

## Contributions

You are free to contribute to this repository. Modify the files with your
favorite text editor or use our ever evolving
[tools](https://github.com/onionltd/oniontree-tools).

For less technical contributors, feel free to open an

community will handle your submission.

Please note that this repository is not trying to be an exhaustive list of
hidden services. There are others that already do that. Check if your
contribution ticks the following:

* Service is usable.
* Service is beautiful.
* Service is useful.
